## Project Rules Gate

Before planning, executing, reviewing, or reporting completion, run `codedungeon rules status` and read `.codedungeon/project-rules.compact.md` when present. If rules are missing, warn the user and recommend `/codedungeon --rules` or `$codedungeon --rules`; do not silently invent project rules. If status is `draft` or `stale`, block `--full` and `--lite` unless the user explicitly says to proceed with stale rules; `--oneshot` may continue with a warning for small direct fixes.

Every plan, task file, review report, phase handoff, and final report must include this Project Rules envelope:

```text
PROJECT_RULES_STATUS: approved|missing|draft|stale
PROJECT_RULES_DIGEST: <rules_digest from codedungeon rules status or none>
PROJECT_RULES_READ: yes|no
```

Use for simple single-repo changes that should be split into a few explicit tasks before implementation.

## Evidence Gates

- Do not write review reports manually. Code review is a standalone module: run `./.codex/bin/codedungeon code-review --url <PR URL> --project-context .codedungeon/project-rules.compact.md --task-context <plan-or-task-context> --out .codedungeon/code-review --post`; legacy `review run` is not final approval evidence.
- Do not write final reports manually. READY_FOR_USER_REVIEW can only come from `codedungeon run finalize`, which closes eligible final phases, cleans stale telemetry, and renders the report after phase, review, git, and QA gates pass.
- Start final verification with `./.codex/bin/codedungeon qa run --phase 6 --fresh --cmd "<first cmd>"`; execute subsequent concrete build/check/test commands with `./.codex/bin/codedungeon qa run --phase 6 --cmd "<cmd>"`.
- Review is mandatory for code-writing workflows; do not treat `Review: APPROVED` as a substitute for `Verification: PASS`.
- This workflow may execute steps only when `CODEDUNGEON_SESSION_TOKEN` is set. Otherwise run `./.codex/bin/codedungeon run --lite --prompt "<prompt>"`.
- Review posting is handled by `codedungeon code-review --post`; arbitrary marker comments do not satisfy `git verify`.
- Do not merge PRs. The user performs final review and merge.

## Agent Telemetry

- Before each task, review, or fix subagent spawn, run `./.codex/bin/codedungeon trace agent-start` with phase, role, agent type, model, effort, task path, and summary.
- After the subagent returns, run `./.codex/bin/codedungeon trace agent-end` with the returned `agent_run_id`, terminal status, result summary, artifact path, and error when present.
- Telemetry is informational and must not replace QA, review, PR, or report evidence gates.

Steps:
- Resolve or write a short plan under `.codedungeon/plans/`.
- Create `.codedungeon/tasks/side-quest/PLAN.md` plus focused `TASK-NNN.md` files.
- Create or switch to `feat/<slug>` and verify with `./.codex/bin/codedungeon git guard --repo .`.
- Execute tasks in order with focused verification.
- Commit, push, and create or reuse a GitHub PR.
- Run `$code-review`; fix requested changes and rerun review for up to 9 cycles.
- Use full review mode for cycles 1-3, then reduced mode for cycles 4-9: keep personas, use fast model/effort, and focus on fixes/new diff.
- Return the standard CodeDungeon PR Report. `READY_FOR_USER_REVIEW` requires pushed branch, open PR URL, recorded adversarial review comment, and `APPROVED` verdict.

Use `$one-shot` when task splitting is unnecessary. Use `$main-quest` for full phase lifecycle work.
